# Reach Docs

This directory contains documentation for different aspects of Reach

Much of the documentation is in the form of markdown with embedded latex.
For rendered preview, vs code provides a nice view, as does stackedit.io.

- [overview](overview.md) contains an overview of
  the Reachability problem and Reach tool. Latex embedded.

- [slides](slides/present.pdf) contains a presentation on Reach focusing on proofs.
  To build, run 'pdflatex present.tex' on a system with teTex or
  similar.

- [uni](uni.md) contains some ideas about unified queueing to
  alleviate the problems based on the 2-phase nature of the algorithms
  on which iic is based. Latex embedded.
